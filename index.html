        <h4>A funny story</h4>
    
        <p>When I was traveling in SE Asia me and 2 friends bought some old motorcycles to ride in Cambodja. <br>
            It was rain season and my friend was not used to riding. So when we had to cross a railway which was on a small
            hill he got stuck in the mud. <br>
            His first reflex was to give full throttle and ofcourse that worked really well. He flew over the railway and
            almost hit a cow.<br>
            <br>
    
    
            
            <b>Friend and Cow were okay!!</b>
        </p>
